# Statistical-concepts

# In this repository I will be discussing the important concepts of data science from statistical point of view.

### I heard in lecture by Dr, Abhinandan Sarkar that statisticians and data-scientist have difference in their approach. On one hand where statistician look for the data collection and interpretation according to the question asked, data scientists have to ask the right question to mine through the data. In this journey, I have been an experimenter with biological data and was on statistician side but as I am starting data science journey would like to understand the both sides.

### Also this repository with not consider with formulas but the concepts with some examples from various literatures or books.
